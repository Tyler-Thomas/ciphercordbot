        'author':'Basil',
        'explanation':'''Al is an aggressive MC that wants to get to 6 bonds as soon as possible to UNTAP. A bit RNG dependent but even on low rolls he can be quite powerful.
His skills are very straightforward- his first skill lets him check the top card of the deck after he attacks, and if it's an Al, he untaps. This works well with fate/courage emblems since you can put an Al from hand on top of your deck to guarantee it goes off. 
His second skill makes the first skill lose once per turn and gives him +10 atk when you're at 6 bonds, meaning he can potentially untap a lot of times.
Because he works best at 6 bonds, you want to ramp to 6 ASAP, and so he runs lots of low costs and fate emblems to rig the stack. Guinivere also works well with him, allowing him to get a card, rig the support for a fate/kete, and/or put an Al to guarantee his untap.
He has a lot of copies of himself in the deck so he can self support if you aren't able to rig fate emblems, but it is also possible to run out of evades if you're constantly stacking them, so cards like Nino work well to make sure he doesn't run out.
Zephiel not only is a solid finisher like in all purple decks, but you can also run his 1 cost that has fate emblem, so you can potentially evade with him and have him stick.
Al's main weakness is that he is hard countered by freyr- if he is locked, then his deck doesn't do much without him. He is also susceptible to bad RNG, sometimes you don't hit the fate emblems or raw Als and he only swings once per turn.''',

One of the most effective (and infuriating) strategies is to promote, overclass Mae on turn 4, cycle/heal to make sure you can make OC again on turn 5, and just lock their board and only attack their MC.
He is also very good with Faye overclass since she nukes an orb and she gets range with Alm on the board. 
For slower options, Celica is nice for board clear (especially after Mae-locking a few times), Delthea can discard, and Genny can orb heal/heal from retreat.''',

        'author':'awesome_sauce',
        'explanation':'''Description: Asugi is more or less another run-of-the-mill Ninja MC, as they all tend to function the same way. Your game plan is to build up your backline by summoning 1 cost ninjas off of Ninjutsu Emblem, then utilizing B17 Kaze 4(3) and B07 Kagero 3(2) to consistently crit with all of your units (more about Kaze and Kagero in the Staples section). What sets Asugi apart from Kaze and Kagero MC is his ability to buff himself for free, as well as using his Skill 1 to draw once per turn off of another knife ally’s deployment. This helps him keep up with consistency and cycling. However, his Skill 1 is also to his detriment, as it tends to restrict his deck to knives only as compared to Kaze and Kagero who can freely run other white units like Ryoma. Luckily, Black and White as a color has access to pretty good knife options, so don’t be afraid to splash Black instead of running Mono-White. Another weakness of his is that he requires more setup due to him needing to get both Kaze and Kagero out in order for crit consistency, as compared to running either Kaze or Kagero as MC. 

Curve: Spend the first few turns trying to build up your backline with 1 costs, or alternatively bridge on turn 2. Promote on turn 3. Get Kagero 3(2) out on turn 4, hide her in the backline, potentially start critting if you have the right cards. Get Kaze 4(3) out on 5, start crit spamming with all of your allies. ''',
        'staples':'''B07 Kagero 3(2): This card allows you to draw a card off of another knife ally’s critical hit. This means that the ally critting doesn’t have to land the hit in order for you to draw. Kagero allows you to basically crit for free, as you can cycle a card off of a crit. Park her in the backline, as she cannot be attacked if a knife ally is in the front line. Dies to destruction and cards that can pull allies.

B17 Kaze 4(3): This card allows you to use any 1 cost card in your hand to crit, instead of using a copy of another card to do so. Also grants you an on-hit draw once per turn, which can grant more opportunities to crit by cycling. Very susceptible to death, as he is a squish 60 base card that will likely survive for only 1 turn unless you have the evades, and tends to be the priority clear target. Make sure you get him out after you have Kagero for perfect curving. If you have nothing better to play, Kaze can be equally potent on his own.

Any card with Ninjutsu Emblem, notably B07 Saizo and Kagero 1, B03 Elise 1. Saizo and Kagero can deploy each other off either one’s Ninjutsu Emblem, and Elise is a Ninjutsu untap at the cost of breaking your own orbs. Elise tends to be very risk-reward.

Techs:
B03 Flora 4(3): Survivability tool that procs Asugi’s Skill 1 to draw him a card on your opponent’s turn. Flip 2 bonds to use this card to redirect an attack and blow up an opposing card with a deployment cost of 2 or lower on death. Usable once per game, time it correctly. Because it's a redirect, you can use this card to save yourself from an unavoidable attack.

B17 Elise 3(2): Consistency tool who flips 1 to heal any card with the same color as your MC (which in this case is any white card).

B07 Yukimura 3(2): Draws a card on another knife ally’s death by an attack and can peek at an orb at the end of your turn. Not as recommended as compared to the other two listed above.'''

        'deck':'Chrom (Yellow)',
        'promo':'Chrom, Sacred Sovereign of Hope',
        'author':'Basil',
        'explanation':'''Chrom is a slower midrange deck that sets up his bonds and retreat to class change multiple allies a turn from retreat to build powerful, value-generating boards quickly.
Chrom's first skill is what makes the deck- flip 2 bonds, class change an ally from retreat. This lets him cheat out powerful allies by only playing the 1 costs (or 0 cost if you're Sigurd).
His second skill is less obviously powerful but is important in making him meta-relevant: giving all cc'd allies +10 means he hits 80, and boost other allies up to hit more reliably.
Yellow is the most popular version of Chrom mostly because of b22 Sigurd- he has a 0 cost you can class change for 2 bond flips, and when he class changes you get a free bond back. If that bond is Seliph, Sigurd net costs 0 bonds to class change and ramps you.
Another less overtly powerful card is Julia. Her 1 cost helps set up your retreat, letting you bond high cost card from hand then send it to retreat for a different on, and her 5 cost lets you net unflip 1 bond, and hits like a truck.
For blue class change targets, Robin (Female) from set 22 is hard to beat. Since you can CC multiple allies per turn, it's possible to easily kill 3, 4 of the opponent's units with her. She can also buff herself and cycle orbs for extra utility.
It's possible (and recommended) to run additional blue CCs for color balancing- Frederick from B22 can make Chrom and himself base 80 and move himself, or Henry can make the opponent discard 2 cards (for a heavy bond flip price).
Chrom runs a lot of bridges, but it is possible for him to be aggro'd down without his 4(3) bridge. He also can be outvalued by traditional control decks that deny him orbs and don't swing as much, making it harder for him to get good class changes in the retreat.''',

The deck's strength lies in its flexibility, however the general function of Chrom as a card remains consistent throughout most builds.

At the start of your Deployment Phase Chrom can deploy a low cost card from your Retreat Area which can then be class changed during your Deployment Phase. In addition to the benefits that come with whatever card you just class changed Chrom's second skill will also draw you an extra card! Whether it's clearing your opponent's board with Female Robin, using Frederick to up Chrom's stats and provide some mobility, or any number of other options it's Chrom's consistency and flexibility that will remain his greatest strength.

Chrom can be built a vast variety of ways, but if you want a good place to start I'd recommend including at least one or two of the following Class Change sets to give yourself a good baseline to work with.''',

        'author':'Llamaboy',
        'explanation':'''This Corrin's gameplan is pretty simple compared to other decks.

The card also has great synergy with Oboro 4/3 because you can discard the 4/3 Oboro and grab the Oboro 1 that moves itself. Up until turn 4, you want to use this combination of cycle from Corrin and draw power from Oboro to generate a lot of crits for your smaller units and hit the opponent's MC. Ideally your finisher for the deck is using B20 Ryoma and B10 Corrin (Male) to flood your board and generate 3-5 attacks in one turn, which should hopefully kill your opponent.''',
        'staples':'''- Oboro (Cost 1 from Set 14 and Cost 4 from Set 7), Oboro is a necessary component of this deck and most white aggro decks because she is your draw engine, as well as a phenomenal early game beat stick.
- Kana (Female) (Cost 1 from Set 2), Dragonkin emblem is a super strong effect, especially in a deck that has a powerful play once they hit 5 bonds. Important for the highroll potential and is a good attacker later on as a 1 cost 60 base
- Any combination of white archers with attack emblem (Such as Kiragi 1 from Set 3, Setsuna 1 from Set 2, and Takumi 1 from Set 2), Lets your units hit more consistently with a huge 40 support on your turn, and since your deck generates crits easily these also serve as long range beat sticks. 
- Ryoma (Cost 5 from Set 20), enables strong tempo plays in tandem with Corrin (Male), also gives you draw power and can hit big numbers
- Corrin (Male) (Cost 6 from Set 10), generates value off bond grab, can summon up to 3 low costs that you can use to hit your opponent with crits. '''

        'explanation':'''Corrin is an MC that is good at keeping control of the board while your opponent expends their resources. By ramping a black card from her hand corrin can destroy 1 non-MC enemy which makes it very hard for your opponent to build a field up without anti-destruction skills for which Corrin can run units with high attack and 1-2 range to help deal with. When added on to her natural bulk because of being an 80 base it makes consistently hitting corrin very hard to pull off. Alongside this bulk Corrin also has 2 bridges that are bulky which helps her avoid being beaten down in the early game (These bridges are Dusk Pursuing Princess, P02, 3/2 and Night Breaks Through the Day, B15, 4/3). Corrin also has a skill that buffs her field by 10 attack, during her turn if she has 2 or more Black bond cards, which due to her skill that kills enemies, is reliable to pull off. These skills together allow Corrin (Female) to become a strong threat in the late game if you play cards that can help get her to the lategame.''',
        'staples':'''Tiki, Immortal Voice, B08, 4- Since Corrin is a 6(5), she promotes fairly late considered to other meta decks. Tiki partly helps to fix this with her skill “Rite of Awakening”, Tiki can flip 1 bond to class change an ally if there is a promotion card in the player’s hand. This means Corrin can promote a turn earlier.  When combined with Corrins ramp skill this also allows other staples to come out earlier than they otherwise could. Also being a base 80 when you have 7 bonds with range 1-2 makes her harder to clear
•    Nowi, Playful Millenary Dragon, B12, 4- Nowi is your bond retrieval in this deck. If Nowi is the first unit to attack this turn she will grab 1 bond and return it tour your hand. This can be used to; grab a black bond to kill another non-MC with corrin, grab a crit or setup a deploy for the following turn. Like Tiki, Nowi gains a buff at 7 bonds but as she has 10 more base attack Nowi is a base 90 with range 1-2. This makes Nowi the strongest unit in the deck at 7 bonds and with a field buff given by Corrin she is the most reliable 100 beater.
•    Genny, Supreme Saint, B11, 4(5)- Genny is one of the other staples I mentioned in Tiki’s description. Her class change cost is higher than her original cost which means Genny is an Overclass. Cards with an Overclass get a skill that activates when you class change into them Genny’s allows you to choose a card from your retreat area to add to your orbs. This is why you wait till you have 6 bonds generally to play her in combination with a Genny 1 cost. But this is not all she does, she also has a flip 3 heal 2 bonds that is not limited to Once Per Turn which can be used here since corrin ramps and on the turn you play genny you can have 7 bonds with only 1 flipped down, Tiki’s skill.'''

        'explanation':'''Dimitri relies on having more orbs than your opponent to obtain his +1 draw OPT. This is helped by the fact that you have 2 options for a turn 2 bridge with 70 attack and Dedue 1 can further increase Dimitri’s attack just by living on the field. If you go first and bridge on turn 2 it is very likely that you will have more orbs by the time you bring in your main promo and can start drawing. However without orb advantage he can become a vanilla MC. The main Promo also gets to destroy a non-MC enemy when his attack destroys and orb. Timing your Byleth CP correctly can help massively to ensure Dimitri doesn’t get hit as often. Turn 5 onwards you can utilise Sothis and Dimitri’s CP’s to give him more actions per turn. Mercedes 5 will help you get units out to use for Dimitri’s CP, she will also buff Dimitri making it easier for him to hit. Dimitri can struggle against the opponent backlining their MC so you can run cards like Hapi and Seteth to get around this issue.''',

        'author':'Basil',
        'explanation':'''Eirika is a very straightforward midrange MC- she is in purple, draws cards where there are 2 other frontline allies, and can prevent a self support once per turn.
Because her skills are very generic and don't require much to build around, she can be built in a number of different ways, playing faster or slower, with different splashes, etc.
The mono-purple build usually skews a bit more aggressive because of cards like Gerik providing good pressure while securing a draw and the abundance of good hero emblems.
Playing Eirika is very easy- early on, play 1 costs and swing to try to get hero emblems or Lilina supports, promote on 3, then play your choice of 4 cost (Gerik, Eliwood, Marisa, Florina).
Free deploys like peony and mirabilis are nice for getting to the 3 frontline benchmark. And of course you have Zephiel as a finisher with a number of low costs to use with him.

Capitalism focuses on Eldigan's Darkness Cleaving Sacred Blade skill to escalated bond counts. This build focuses on flipping bonds for ally skills more than deploying horse units from bonds.

The only slight complexity of this deck lies in managing your bonds to make sure you have strong turns after you promote. In the early stages of the game, you should bond Eldigans over anything else, with the only exception being against other aggressive decks where you bond some of the heavier cards in your hand in favor of maintaining tempo and field advantage. Depending on the deck you're facing, you can opt to bridge on turn 2(if they are more aggressive) or turn 3(if they are slower and you can output more damage on turn 2). As far as big cards go, you'll want to prioritize saving Ares over anything else that goes into bonds, as Ares provides a pull when bonded, which can very easily turn the tides for Eldigan. Sigurd ST+, if you run it, should be the lowest priority to keep on hand and the card you can most easily drop into bonds. Beowulf, usually considered a must run in previous sets, has fallen out of favor, but if you opt to run it, you should prioritize holding him, although not more than Ares.''',

Alternatively, if you opponent play a dangerous 1 range unit, you can use his skill 2 to push it to the backline so they can't just deploy another one next turn.

This can also make it easier for lowcost units such as Josh 1 and Al 1 to hit bigger opponents. These lowcosts can also be redeployed by Gerik 4 and will buff frontline as a result, further increasing the chances of units hitting.

Hilda herself isn't very noteworthy- she simply deploys brown cards with an attack of 70 or higher by tapping, and gets +30 during your turn when your hand is low (which will be often).
Her main advantage over other Brown MCs is that she is tempo-focused, deploying strong cards like Seiros, Dimitri, and Edelgard and starting on turn 3.
She can also still use the typical brown power cards like Byleth and Sothis CP, helping her survive aggro and put pressure on late respectively.
Since her hand gets low even faster than usual brown due to extra deploys, Kronya is a good inclusion in most versions as a small engine to keep cards and attacks coming.

        'author': 'Darrman',
        'explanation':'''The king of the New Kingdom of Thracia has one aim: keep unifying Thracia. In order to do that, he needs to get as many bonds as possible as fast as possible.
Unifier of Thracia (or Unify) is the main focus of the deck. When building the deck, aim to include Unify targets. Be aware of its reasonably steep cost: flip 2 and discard an evade. Bring Leaves: 14-16 will do.
His bond skill, Prince's Reparation, is also powerful. Bonding him is safe. He can be swapped at any time for a non-Leif card, such as B08 Seliph to unflip a bond. There's no need to swap Leif with anyone.
Finally, his second skill ensures his hits double-break.

Curve:
Leif's curve has him reach a minimum of eight bonds by turn 5 in order to activate Unify to summon two yellow units from the retreat.
Bridge on Turn 2 into B17 3/2 and play Lewyn/Sigurd 0. Tap the 0 cost to ramp.
The next turn, promote into B15 4/3 to ramp directly from hand face-down. If you ramped on T2, Deirdre 4 works too.
Leif has two respectable Turn 4 plays available to him. Playing Sigurd 0 into 5 is a powerful two-card combo that lets you bond from retreat. Grabbing promo or a Seliph to unflip a bond are both good options. Sigurd can buff with a Seliph. If you don't have T4 Sigurd, Deirdre is a good 4 drop.
By Turn 5 you should have eight bonds after your bond phase. If not, B22 Leif is a backup. Activate Unifier and summon two units. Sigurd and Julia are the best targets, with Deirdre or Seliph as backups.

Leif is weak to aggro. He does have a lot of evades, but this also increases the chance he will self. Mull for 3/2 here. Do not attack face against aggro decks until they have run out of steam. Don't punch Oboro especially.
Beware of deck reset: running 51-52 cards may be worth it. Rhea CP shuts you down. Run grey cards at your peril: Deirdre ramps face-down if she hits one and Julia can't flip them.''',

* B17 Deirdre 4 & B06 Deirdre 1
Always a good play to ramp. Reveal Seliph and you +1; hit non-yellow for a -1. Tap her to kill dragons.
Deirdre 1 swaps a bond with a card in retreat. Swap a Unify target like Julia for Leif/Seliph.

* B08 Seliph 5
1: He unflips bonds if bonded by effect. Deirdre, Julia, or B10 Leif BS all work.
2: He buffs everyone by 10 if you've three yellow bonds face up; use Julia here.
3: Final Holy War. Discard a Seliph to add as many bonds as you want to your hand, typically a +5-6. Synergises with B10 Nanna's ramp and B19 Lana, who can heal Seliphs.

* B19 Julia 5
She can swap three bonds out to get three bonds in. Ideal cards to swap out include Unify targets, Seliphs, and non-yellow cards.
Usually gives +1 on face-up bonds: hit Seliph to go +2, or hit Nanna to grab a bond back. She's a good beater as well; use Deirdre's ramp after Julia's summoned to hit 100.
Do not use her if under 3 cards in deck.

Leif is quite flexible. Run these as 1-2 of and summon off Unify.
B15 Travant 5 discards a bond to cut enemy hand to 5.
B17 Arvis 4 kills an enemy if you've 8 bonds.

B10 Nanna 5, when bonded, can retrieve a bond. Watch out for the 10 support. (But they're too cute together!)
B19 Lana 3 can flip 1 heal if an enemy has >=80 attack.
B12 Lachesis 4 & B08 Tine 3 have draw power BSes.
B19 Seliph unflips a bond when something is deployed. Unifying him counts.

As a result, this deck should only be seriously considered for tourney play in legacy or tier 3 formats that operate on lower power levels.  If you like Lon'qu and really want to play him in a regular tourney, just play the standard build and you'll probably find some success with it while having fun.  If you still want to play this variant in serious play in the modern-day format, this is hell you're walking into.

Your gameplan is simple: build an army of Sword Risen to power Lon'qu's first skill and become big enough to shrug off any attack.  Lon'qu should always be swinging at your opponent's main character, unless they have a dangerous unit on board that can threaten your backline.  If your opponent has lost enough orbs, activate Killing Edge and chain it with Shannan 3/2's bond skill to get multiple unavoidable attacks and win the game.
Important Interactions:
* Unless you really need to hit a backline low-attack enemy with Grima, every single unit you deploy should go on the backline and supply Lon'qu with buffs (or in Frederick 4(3)'s case, crit protection).
* Because your support base sucks, you'll have to rely on Chrom's +70 buff to allies in order to hit any important enemy.
* If you have 3 or fewer risen in the retreat, save Grima's ACT skill after you do all intended attacks for the turn so that you can potentially pull a Despair Emblem and summon extra Risen.
* Watch for Deck Reset.

This deck loses to:
* Anything with more than 1 ranged unit (most modern-day decks)
* Anything with a consistently high attack value to punch through your defense (Tempo Fliers)
* Turn 5 Combo Decks set up faster than you can stabilize

Her first skill growths her to give her +30 atk for the turn, meaning she can swing for 90 + support with range- very good for controling the board or hitting tankier MCs.
Her second skill is what really makes her work though- every time she is growthed, if you have 4 or fewer cards in hand, she gets to draw a card.
With the two skills in mind, it's pretty easy to see how the deck is built- you need a low hand size and micaiah's in the retreat to be able to grow, so you run a lot of Micaiahs.
Having a lot of micaiahs lets her evade early to get to a low hand size and puts micaiahs in the retreat to growth. You can run low cost mill cards like Ashunera or Elincia 1 cost to help with this as well.
Because neither of her skills require bond flips, she can run bond-heavy support cards like Jill and Kurthnaga, and often replays them multiple times since she draws through her deck so quickly.
She is, however, still a mage MC on defense, so she can potentially be beaten down by aggro/tempo decks that hit a lot (she also tends to self a lot, so she can be hit by 1 costs).

        'explanation': '''Welcome, to yellow red control. Your goal is to curve into your bridge and into your main promo, ramping up as you go, and then quickly deploying ocs afterwards, specifically delthea and genny, to help stabilize and play your gameplan. Exceptions come against other control decks, as most control decks will outvalue and outlast you, but most of the time you should be ignoring the enemy mc and clearing the board. or even just passing turn if you have nothing to clear

Your ideal curve is Turn 2 3(2) bridge, Turn 3 Main Promo, and Turn 4 either Genny or Delthea OC, depending on what mc you are playing against. (A single delthea or genny can entirely shut down an aggro deck, and Delthea especially can be extremely punishing if the enemy has yet to promo). If you missed your main promo. curving into Deirdre 4(3) B17 on turn 3 also allows you to curve into OC the next turn, but it is slightly less ideal. (This should make it clear however, Mulligan for your bridge. it is more important)

The difficulty with this deck does not come with what to do on the first few turns of curves, it comes with how you manage your bond skills, knowing when to deploy and when not to, and managing which cards to heal to allow you to both survive, and continue to execute your gameplan.

Once you've stabilized with enough OCs and enemy burning their resources, then you can start punching them in the face. Sometimes you have to punch earlier, but that is a matchup to matchup and situation to situation scenario. 

Your finisher is often a 2-3 man unify deploy (From Leif 5(4) B10)), or grabbing a lot of your bonds with Holy War (with B08 Seliph). Before that, play around with using Leif 5(4)'s bond skill to bond Seliph's to unflip a bond. You can also bond other copies of your Nanna 5(4) to grab (prefarably fipped) bonds into your hand.

Skill two lets you flip a bond to draw a card when another ally is supported by a Nino- so in conjunction with skill 1, you can stack a dodge on top of deck, get a dodge back from retreat, then attack with something else and flip 1 to draw.
She also can rig support skills such as Lilina for free draws, darkness emblems to make the opponent discard, or even X supports to make sure an attack hits.
Being a 60 attack MC can be rough, but because you are able to get dodges back for free, she can be surprisingly hard to kill, so leaving her in the front and backlining other mages is a viable option.
However, even though she can dodge, critting is less recommended unless you know you can kill- so she tends to rely on Peony to hit.
There are two main versions of Nino- Mono Purple, where you run cards like Canas, Lute, and Lilina to draw a lot of cards and use their range to control the board.
And Brown- You include tempo cards like Hilda, Byleth F, and Eliwood X to get multiple deploys a turn. You also typically run more high supports, meaning Nino is less reliant on buffs.''',

        'author':'BanjoMW',
        'explanation':'''Oboro has been one of the best MC’s in the game since the release of her 1 cost in B14. This card allowed Oboro to consistently be able to class change regardless of the field state, provided you have the bonds for it. Oboro has the advantage over other MC’s of being able to class change herself from the retreat area which potentially gives her the use of another evade early on which is why some decks tend to prefer not hit Oboro early to prvent an early promotion Once you have promo in your retreat Oboro essentially becomes Flip 1 to move Oboro and draw 1 card, (stays promoted) if she has not yet been tapped this turn. This sequence is not limited to Once Per Turn meaning Oboro can outdraw most decks. 
 The best way to play Oboro is to aggro your opponent since u will be outdrawing them once main promo is out. This will also allow her to restabilize if aggro plays don’t kill your opponent. Within Oboro you don’t really want to be running any non White cards as they can end up stuck in your hand since they don't allow Oboro to reclass change as Oboro requires White bonds to do that.''',
        'staples':''' 8-12 Attack Emblem Archers – These will be your main source of aggression in the early game as you try to get a copy of Main Promo into your retreat area. These will also buff Oboro due to Oboro’s Main Promo gaining +10 attack when a bow is on field
•    Ryoma, Brave King of Dawn Walking with the Dusk, B20 5(4) – This card can tap an ally to deploy another <White> ally which synergises well with Oboro as well as encouraging a more aggressive playstyle since Ryoma can help regain a big hand when your hand is 3 or lower since Ryoma will draw 1 card after his attack, this can be timed with Oboro’s draws to be optimised.
•    Corrin (Male), Divine Son of the Dazzling Dawn Dragon, B10, 6(5) – The amount of lowcosts you have in the deck allows Corrin to deploy multiple units in one turn which can be a problem for your opponent since they would spend a lot of their resources to clear stuff before Corrin is deployed, Also buffs field if 2 or more face-up bonds which can be timed well with oboro to hit as hard as possible on as many attacks as possible
•    Kaze, Faithful Verdancy, B17, 4(3) – Gives many more options to crit opponent which can be valuable if your opponent choses to buff themselves to a higher attack value than your units. Also gives greater attack power to lowcosts that have potentially been able to stay on the field from the earlygame.
•    Takumi, Prince of Brilliant Winds, B07, 4(3) – Similar to Ryoma, Takumi has a method to deploy other units however it is limited to bows and you need an orb to do so, these conditions are fairly easy to meet due to the amount of bow units oboro runs and the fact that people don’t like to aggro her down, however his best use in Oboro is to stop opposing MC’s from running away. This allows you to put further pressure on opposing MC’s'''

        'explanation':'''Owain is a funny gimmick combo deck. His promotion allows him to always double break while allowing him to buff himself to absurd amount of power. You spend the first turns promoting and building your combo by stacking shannan BS in your bonds so you can make a big push before dying.
On the combo turn, you will pull your opponent's MC if necessary, buff owain with the other units, then double his power. On the perfect curves, owain hill attack 5 times. Witch is in most cases enought to kill your opponent or finish him with another unit.''',
        'staples':'''Staples:
- Shannan, Isaachian Swordmaster, B08 3(2) -  They are your main combo tool. Alloying Owain to untap without having to deploy a dancer. The big drawback is the attacking unit losing 30 atk each time. But you can easilly make owain strong enough for it not to be an issue.
- Deirdre, Maiden of the Spirit Forest, B06 1 - This card allows you to swap the bond of your choice with any card in your retreat area. Making stacking shannan in your bonds more consistent.
- Arvis, Head of House Velthomer, B06 1 - Arvis have one of the most efficient pull in the game. He is cheap to deploy and can pull your opponent's MC without spending valuables ressources.
- Sigurd, A Soul Who Lived for Love, B19 0 and Sigurd, Holy Honor-Imparting Knight, B22 5(4) promoting combo - Promoting sigurd 5(4) on top of his cost 0 allows you to class change him on turn 4. By doing it, you will add a bond from your retreat for free. He has also the great power of buffing a unit for 30 until the end of your opponent's turn by flipping a "Sigurd" or "Seliph" bond. This buff can be doubled by Owain first skill afterwards.

Techs:

- Lewyn, Resurrected Wind, B19 0 - This card helps you to get more cards in your retreat and/or to deploy low cost yellow unit without destroying your hand. The fact that stacked cards goes in your retreat at the end of the turn is a bit annoying tho.
- Ares, Nostalgic Black Prince, B12 4(3) - Ares is both an additionnal double-break attack that can be bast 90 and a pulling tech is your hand is low enough. Having 3 face up bonds for the double break effect is pretty simple, but the +20 and the bond skill requirements are more situationnal.
- Julia, The God of Light's Descendant, B08 4(3) - Another tool that helps you putting the right cards in your bonds, but have a destroying requirement that can easilly be avoided by your opponent.'''

        'explanation': '''Raven is a deck that focuses on critical hits from Raven himself to rush your opponent down. 

When attacking the opponent's main character with Raven, using a critical hit forces them to destroy an orb, potentially double breaking orbs for that attack. Walling Raven out by denying him orbs to stall him out is also less-effective as Raven can send an orb to retreat to draw 2 cards once per turn with his second skill. 

Its recommended to play more aggressively with Raven, as he lacks long-term survivability. Running cards that can drag the opponent's Lord from the backline, such as Eliwood (B07 4/3) will prevent you from getting stalled out by a big frontline.

Cards that fetch copies of Raven, like Lucius, will allow you to regain Ravens for surviving on the defence or keeping up his offensive. Canas also allows you to stack your Priscillas/other Purple tomes for increased pressure.''',

- Priscilla, Secluded Valkyrie (B07 Cost 3/2) is a defensive support that completely negates the enemy's attack if supporting Raven.

- Priscilla, Ever at my Lord Brother's Side... (B21 Cost 4/3) is an attack support that draws you 1 upon supporting her when attacking with Raven. As a deployed unit, she can Flip 1 to fetch a 1 cost from retreat to enable either Raven or your other cards.

- Canas, Benighted Smile (B13 Cost 4/3) allows you to stack tomes as you'd like, which opens up techs like Dark Emblems and Lilina 5 for increased pressure.

- Eliwood, Knight of Lycia (B07 Cost 4/3) lets you stack a card to move an enemy from backline, useful for chasing opponents who tap move back.'''

        'explanation':'''Roy is universally accepted as THE purple stacker MC, taking advantage of purple's strong support skills on a character that has good stats and plenty of options for building.
His skills are very straightforward- skill 1 puts a card on top of your deck to give roy +10 until next turn and range 1-2, and his second skill lets him draw a card at the end of the turn if he used skill 1.
So as a base, he is base 80 with range that cycles a card. Not bad, but surely on turn 4 that's a bit underwhelming? 
Nope. Not only is he in purple so he can stack cards like Lilina and Lute for draws or Canas and Raigh for discards, but he also gets the purple manaketes.
Roy has a 1 cost that lets him draw and put a card on top of deck when he hits, so that in addition to a number of 1 costs lets him ramp at least once fairly reliably before turn 4.
He also has a number of alt promos and bridges to choose from, including the bridge that can function as a main promo itself, B21-HR Roy.
Then when you combine him with cards like Canas 4 to rig more tome stacks and Zephiel as a finisher, roy becomes a midrange king that can draw, discard, cycle, and has no problems hitting.
While he is considered a top 5 MC, he does have some weaknesses. Freyr can bother him since he wants to kete, and if he does the opponent gets more out of it, and since roy is 80 with his buff freyr can lock him.
It's also possible for roy to struggle with aggro, Oboro is particularly annoying since she wants to avoid his early face swings anyway.''',

Her first skill, "A New World", defines the deck- by restarting the turn after the deploy phase, the player gets another draw, another bond, and the ability to deploy again.
Since the skill is both ramp and tempo, it allows her to play many more high cost units than other decks, and a few unique ones such as Zelgius.
Her second skill is useful as well- discarding 2 to draw 2 is nice cycle and gives her the ability to hit the opponent's backline. 
Because of her extra draw from new world, her ability to cycle, and her ability to run high cost value cards such as Tormod and Micaiah, she can be very consistent.
She does have a few key weaknesses- the obvious one is that New World forces her to stay in green for the most part, and if the opponent is running Veronica 22, then the skill becomes unusable.
So also is very weak to start- her typical 1 cost 30 atk 1 cost that can't attack, so she is very reliant on getting a bridge to not die in the early game, and going second hurts her more than most.''',

Yes, it's that simple. The only few things worth noting, is that even though the B19 5(4) is your intended "final" promo, you don't want to promote on curve if you have low cost units to deploy during those turns. The first 3 turns of the game are the most important for this type of deck, because that's where you get the vast majority of your damage in, so your ideal curve should look like this:
        -Turn 1: Beater.
        -Turn 2: 2 Beaters.
        -Turn 3: Bridge into 3(2) and deploy 1 beater.
        It's important to play more beaters early, because they have better odds of hitting, around turn 3 is when most MCs promote into base 70s or 60s, so it's a good opportunity to level up your MC and play 1 more beater to maintain pressure.
        Aside from that, there's a very slight resource management component in your Larcei bonds aka your way to cheat people out of games.

        'explanation':'''It's a midrange deck, meaning you aim to take control of the game or in some cases, finish it by turn 5. There's not really much of a secret to playing this deck's first few turns, you just play your curve aggressively to set yourself up to win by turn 5 or turn 6 by utilizing Ike and/or Caeda. Sigrun rewards playing your curve as it naturally fills the condition for her summoning skill as your opponent clears your low cost units, so there's really no reason to keep holding on to them. After you promote, your priority should be getting the floodgate fairies onto the field as they are very good tap fodder for Sigrun's skill, providing value even though they can't hit. You should be using Sigrun's tap for +20 most of the time, because this deck normally runs 12 to 16 Sigruns, so get ready for unpleasant Sigrun selfs. Once the fairies have hit the field, you can think about the matchup you're playing, if Plumeria can significantly hinder your opponent's deploys (such as against big purple), you can opt to playing a slower game by stablishing more field presence before just going for game with Ike and Caeda 5.

-Haar 1: This card does just about everything Sigrun could want it to, it's good tap fodder, it provides movement on support and on field, and you can crit with it.
-Plumeria 2: This card hard presses top heavy decks to continuously remove her just so they can play the game, she also happens to be a 1-2 range, so she has additional utility by being able to crit from the backline when needed.
-Ike 4(3) B22: Your alternative to Caeda to end games. A bit harder to set up than Caeda, but he doubles as a removal tool. Being a 70 base in a flier deck is also an advantage.

-Mirabilis: Extremely useful in matchups where Zephiel exists, still good when he doesn't. Being a 0 cost colorless card is just a very nice tool for Sigrun to have, and while some may argue she's not a must have, there's very few cases where she hurts your deck for being there. '''

However, his downside is that he only has 2 printed cards in the game, leaving him with 6 usable evades after promoting. Your gameplan can vary, as you can either try to aggro your opponent out as fast as possible and use B12 Elincia 5(3) to lethally untap, or you can play a little slower and focus on clearing field using B16 Kurthnaga 4 and B09 Jill 5(3). However, don’t play too slow, as Stefan is a very bond-heavy MC, meaning once you burn through all of your bonds, you will essentially run out of resources, and everything will start to become fairly vanilla. Once he growths twice after promoting, his attacks become unavoidable by non-mcs, so use this to clear your opponent’s field. In this deck, there will NEVER be an instance in which you want to bond your evades because of how limited they are and how they can be used to untap Stefan.

Curve: Deploy 1 costs on turns 1 and 2, notably Kurthnaga, who can get cards in your retreat to growth with and swing for 60, as well as B12 Ike N+X who can buff Stefan on-hit for +10 on opponent’s turn. Promote on 3, and after promoting keep this in mind: always attack with Stefan first so you can untap him with your other units later. Deploy Kurthnaga 4 on turn 4, heal Jill for the following turn so you can redeploy Kurth if he dies. Jill on turn 5 if Kurth is dead, otherwise you can play cards like Elincia or Soren. Keep healing evades or high costs with Kurth and untap your way to victory! 
''',
        'staples':'''Staples:
B16 Kurthnaga 4: Your main consistency piece and backline access. Raw deploy him on turn 4 or use Jill to summon him. Kurth can heal literally anything in your deck, as a lot of your key pieces are cost 5 and above. Use him to heal Jill to recycle Kurth if he dies, Yune if you need to board wipe, Elincia if you need to lethal, or evades because Stefan has the luxury of being a 5(3). NEVER DEPLOY HIM IN THE BACKLINE. He only gets his buffs from other 5 costs if he is in the frontline, so park him up front and let him sit for big numbers.

B09 Jill 5(3): Your main tool for getting Kurth out. Flips 2 to deploy a fang ally with deployment cost 4 or lower, you will always be using this to summon Kurth from your retreat. Also hits for 80, can growth an ally on-hit, and has good flier support base. Swing with Stefan first and hope Jill lands her attack to untap Stefan.

B12 Elincia 5(3): Your lethality piece. Can growth another ally after her attack, and can untap herself by sending another Elincia to retreat as a Class Change skill. Buff her up with Peony and use her to untap Stefan twice in a turn when going in for the kill.

B20 Yune 6: Wipes board and buffs for +30 on enemy phase. Use this when you’re in a tricky spot!

P03 Soren 3(2): A good alternative or addition for lethality alongside Elincia 5(3). Flips 1 to grow Stefan if he lands hits, meaning that you can keep chaining attacks with Stefan as long as he hits something and has copies of himself in retreat. 

Techs:
B21 Freyr 0: A tech card that functions extremely well in Stefan. Flip 1 to lock an 80 base enemy. Stefan has a low evade count, this can limit the amount of enemies your opponent can attack with. Can also be used to bond accel if your opponent ramps using a kete.

You spend the rest of your time controlling the board by destroying enemy units and buffing your own MC to avoid getting hit, while avoiding hitting the opposing MC as to not give them orbs until you are greatly ahead of them on cards in hand, not a hard feat for this deck in the late game.''',
        'staples':'''-Rowan/Lianna 3/2, B11: Kind of obvious you want bridges, but you want as many copies as possible as they have the cheapest CC cost, basically making them draw a card for every 2 Bonds you have.
-Wrys 2, B22: Due to a weird quirk of how Cipher works, a unit with no cards stacked under them is considered not leveled up, even if that unit is a 4/3 that just became your MC like the Twins are, so Wrys is able to use his buff after you HS, making him the most important card to add, regardless of color.
-Tiki 5, B17: Tiki allows you to both pick up flipped bonds in the late game, or to bond one of your many cards gained from CCing, allowing you to spend more flips on Rowan's skill and have more overall bonds to CC more copies of MC.
-Mercedes 4/3, B18: Use her CP to heal more copies of 3/2 Twins, or other cards if need be, don't actually deploy her.
-Henry 3/2, B01: The reason to play blue, Henry allows you to turn all of your CCs from drawing cards to making your opponent discard cards, your best way to win the game.
-Ilyana 5/3, B14: Turns your many cards in hand into destruction, while also letting you flip 1 to draw per enemy destroyed with Lianna's skill 3, one of the big draws to play green.
-Sigurd 5/4, B22: Gives +30 to your MC while also ramping you and unflipping a bond when you CC him with Sigud 0 from B19 and Seliph 5/4 from B08, all things Twins wants, making him the main draw of yellow.'''
