        'explanation':'''This Corrin's gameplan is pretty simple compared to other decks. The main function of the MC is to work as an engine to generate crits for your units by adding low costs from your retreat to your hand. The card also has great synergy with Oboro 4/3 because you can discard the 4/3 Oboro and grab the Oboro 1 that moves itself. Up until turn 4, you want to use this combination of cycle from Corrin and draw power from Oboro to generate a lot of crits for your smaller units and hit the opponent's MC. Ideally your finisher for the deck is using B20 Ryoma and B10 Corrin (Male) to flood your board and generate 3-5 attacks in one turn, which should hopefully kill your opponent.''',
        'staples':'''- Oboro (Cost 1 from Set 14 and Cost 4 from Set 7), Oboro is a necessary component of this deck and most white aggro decks because she is your draw engine, as well as a phenomenal early game beat stick.
- Kana (Female) (Cost 1 from Set 2), Dragonkin emblem is a super strong effect, especially in a deck that has a powerful play once they hit 5 bonds. Important for the highroll potential and is a good attacker later on as a 1 cost 60 base
- Any combination of white archers with attack emblem (Such as Kiragi 1 from Set 3, Setsuna 1 from Set 2, and Takumi 1 from Set 2), Lets your units hit more consistently with a huge 40 support on your turn, and since your deck generates crits easily these also serve as long range beat sticks. 
- Ryoma (Cost 5 from Set 20), enables strong tempo plays in tandem with Corrin (Male), also gives you draw power and can hit big numbers
- Corrin (Male) (Cost 6 from Set 10), generates value off bond grab, can summon up to 3 low costs that you can use to hit your opponent with crits.

This is helped by the fact that you have 2 options for a turn 2 bridge with 70 attack and Dedue 1 can further increase Dimitri’s attack just by living on the field. If you go first and bridge on turn 2 it is very likely that you will have more orbs by the time you bring in your main promo and can start drawing. However without orb advantage he can become a vanilla MC. The main Promo also gets to destroy a non-MC enemy when his attack destroys and orb. Timing your Byleth CP correctly can help massively to ensure Dimitri doesn’t get hit as often. Turn 5 onwards you can utilise Sothis and Dimitri’s CP’s to give him more actions per turn. Mercedes 5 will help you get units out to use for Dimitri’s CP, she will also buff Dimitri making it easier for him to hit. Dimitri can struggle against the opponent backlining their MC so you can run cards like Hapi and Seteth to get around this issue.''',

        'explanation': '''Best used as MC. Benefits from 80 base power. Can play 3 different variants: Frozen Knights (Combo), Swordbois (Aggro), and Capitalism (Late Game)

Frozen Knights utilizes Eldigan's Cross Knight's, Move Out skill to create a powerful board through chained deployment skills. Requires careful planning and setup to be effective. Struggles against base 100 mcs. B19 Erinys 4, B17 Sigurd 4 are key.

Swordbois focuses on an aggressive approach with cost 1 sword affinity units. Adding multiple units with "Hero Emblem" support skill increases your chance of rushing your opponent down to 0 orbs by turn 3. Your ideal turn 4 is B15 Leif 4. Turn 5 deploy Peony 3, and B12 Beowulf 4 for the finisher.

Capitalism focuses on Eldigan's Darkness Cleaving Sacred Blade skill to escalated bond counts. This build focuses on flipping bonds for ally skills more than deploying horse units from bonds. Utilize Linoan 3 for consistency, and B17 Deirdre 4 for bond acceleration. B10 Leif 5, and B19 Julia 5 are key.''',

        'explanation':'''Fairly straightforward aggressive midrange deck, you play your curve and beat people to death. The only slight complexity of this deck lies in managing your bonds to make sure you have strong turns after you promote. In the early stages of the game, you should bond Eldigans over anything else, with the only exception being against other aggressive decks where you bond some of the heavier cards in your hand in favor of maintaining tempo and field advantage. Depending on the deck you're facing, you can opt to bridge on turn 2(if they are more aggressive) or turn 3(if they are slower and you can output more damage on turn 2). As far as big cards go, you'll want to prioritize saving Ares over anything else that goes into bonds, as Ares provides a pull when bonded, which can very easily turn the tides for Eldigan. Sigurd ST+, if you run it, should be the lowest priority to keep on hand and the card you can most easily drop into bonds. Beowulf, usually considered a must run in previous sets, has fallen out of favor, but if you opt to run it, you should prioritize holding him, although not more than Ares.''',
        'staples':'''-Ares 4(3) B12: Pull when bonded at a low hand, which happens quite often in Eldigan, double orb break and 90 attack. What's not to love about the Lionheart's son?

Early game, you want to attack your opponent with as many of your low costs as you can, and if any of them stick, you can use them for tap fodder later. Once you have your main promo, You can use his third skill to tap one of your lost costs that won't hit your opponent to break two orbs with Eliwood. You can use any of your units that your opponent backlined, or your low costs that won't hit, to activate his skill 4 to make your entire field +10, and this skill is not once per turn.

Alternatively, if you opponent play a dangerous 1 range unit, you can use his skill 2 to push it to the backline so they can't just deploy another one next turn. You can use his skill 1 to deploy a Myrrh 1 on turn 3, if your opponent has not promoted to get an extra hit, or to deploy a low cost if you need more tap fodder.''',

This almost negates one of the biggest problem’s that swordmasters have in that they’re 10 supports meaning they have worse supports than most other cards in the game which can cause them to lose interactions because of their supports, now they tie on support essentially with most non flier decks thanks to fir. This can also make it easier for lowcost units such as Josh 1 and Al 1 to hit bigger opponents. These lowcosts can also be redeployed by Gerik 4 and will buff frontline as a result, further increasing the chances of units hitting. Another way to play Fir is that you can run high supports such as Green’s (mostly) Sword Fliers and Purple’s x supports to try to ensure she wins all combat interactions.''',

Her first skill lets you put a card from hand on top of the deck to get a dodge back from retreat, so your hand stays the same size when you stack and you get a "free" dodge.
Skill two lets you flip a bond to draw a card when another ally is supported by a Nino- so in conjunction with skill 1, you can stack a dodge on top of deck, get a dodge back from retreat, then attack with something else and flip 1 to draw.
She also can rig support skills such as Lilina for free draws, darkness emblems to make the opponent discard, or even X supports to make sure an attack hits.
Being a 60 attack MC can be rough, but because you are able to get dodges back for free, she can be surprisingly hard to kill, so leaving her in the front and backlining other mages is a viable option.
However, even though she can dodge, critting is less recommended unless you know you can kill- so she tends to rely on Peony to hit.
There are two main versions of Nino- Mono Purple, where you run cards like Canas, Lute, and Lilina to draw a lot of cards and use their range to control the board.
And Brown- You include tempo cards like Hilda, Byleth F, and Eliwood X to get multiple deploys a turn. You also typically run more high supports, meaning Nino is less reliant on buffs.''',

    'Raven':{
        'deck': 'Raven, Unquenched Flame of Vengeance',
        'promo': 'Unquenched Flame of Vengeance (B21 4/3)',
        'author': 'Hochweisse',
        'explanation': '''Raven is a deck that focuses on critical hits from Raven himself to rush your opponent down. 

When attacking the opponent's main character with Raven, using a critical hit forces them to destroy an orb, potentially double breaking orbs for that attack. Walling Raven out by denying him orbs to stall him out is also less-effective as Raven can send an orb to retreat to draw 2 cards once per turn with his second skill. 

Its recommended to play more aggressively with Raven, as he lacks long-term survivability. Running cards that can drag the opponent's Lord from the backline, such as Eliwood (B07 4/3) will prevent you from getting stalled out by a big frontline.

Cards that fetch copies of Raven, like Lucius, will allow you to regain Ravens for surviving on the defence or keeping up his offensive. Canas also allows you to stack your Priscillas/other Purple tomes for increased pressure.''',
        'staples':'''- Lucius, Eliminean Monk (B21 Cost 2) allows you to prevent non-MC crits on your MC, while also serving to heal Raven Copies.

- Priscilla, Secluded Valkyrie (B07 Cost 3/2) is a defensive support that completely negates the enemy's attack if supporting Raven.

- Priscilla, Ever at my Lord Brother's Side... (B21 Cost 4/3) is an attack support that draws you 1 upon supporting her when attacking with Raven. As a deployed unit, she can Flip 1 to fetch a 1 cost from retreat to enable either Raven or your other cards.

- Canas, Benighted Smile (B13 Cost 4/3) allows you to stack tomes as you'd like, which opens up techs like Dark Emblems and Lilina 5 for increased pressure.

- Eliwood, Knight of Lycia (B07 Cost 4/3) lets you stack a card to move an enemy from backline, useful for chasing opponents who tap move back.'''

        'author':'Kokuusho',
        'explanation': '''Robin(Female), aka frobin, is an mc who is all about making what you are doing consistent. She lets you plan around what orbs you take and gets you some free value by adding facedown bonds you want to orbs and orbs you want to your hand. She also has a draw 2 discard 2 to in a pinch. 
She is mainly played with Dragon Emblems and Mae 3(4) overclass, where she lets you consistently get fast and multiple Mae overclasses to keep your opponent's board tapped down for multiple turns and lets you find crits for your units to kill your opponent. If you don't win during your Mae overclasses, you can wipe the board with rowan5(4) or hapi4(3). ''',
        'staples':'''**Dragon Emblems and Fate Emblems:** 
Choose 12-16: B08 Tiki 1, B08 Nah 1, B12 Nowi 1, B01 Nowi 1
Choose 4-8: B08 Robin(f) 1, B08 Lucina 1, B08 Chrom 1, B14 Morgan(Male) 1
These let you add more bonds to your bond area early so you can Mae overclass Faster. A good distribution is 4 Tiki1, 4 Nah 1, 4 B12 Nowi 1, 4 Robin(f) 1, 3 Lucina 1.
 **Mae:** 
B09 Mae 1, B16 Mae 1, B16 Mae 3(4), B18 Mercedes 4(3)
Run max of all of these and 2-3 set 9 Mae4(3) for evades. You want to have 14-16 Mae to keep your mae on the board/ have another 2 Mae in your hand for another overclass. Mercedes 4(3) lets you grab more Mae or crits for your other units.
 **Board Wipes:** 
B22 Rowan 5(4), B21 Hapi4(3)
Play these after you are out of Mae Overclasses to clear your opponents board. Rowan cleans everything if there are 4 or more Non-MC. Hapi clears 2 things if there are 3 or more Non-MC.  Run one or the other as a 2-3 of.'''

        'author':'Aku',
        'explanation':'''This is about as simple as a deck gets in cipher, you play cards in your curve and ship all the damage to the other main character and hope they die before you run out of cards... Yes, it's that simple. The only few things worth noting, is that even though the B19 5(4) is your intended "final" promo, you don't want to promote on curve if you have low cost units to deploy during those turns. The first 3 turns of the game are the most important for this type of deck, because that's where you get the vast majority of your damage in, so your ideal curve should look like this:
        -Turn 1: Beater.
        -Turn 2: 2 Beaters.
        -Turn 3: Bridge into 3(2) and deploy 1 beater.
        It's important to play more beaters early, because they have better odds of hitting, around turn 3 is when most MCs promote into base 70s or 60s, so it's a good opportunity to level up your MC and play 1 more beater to maintain pressure.
        Aside from that, there's a very slight resource management component in your Larcei bonds aka your way to cheat people out of games. You'll want to time your deirdre deploys to make sure you can flip those bonds face up or add another Larcei bond... yeah, that's it, that's all the complexity this deck has.''',
        'staples':'''-Lewyn 0: FREE CARDS, YOU DON'T EXIST WITHOUT THIS CARD.
-Larcei 4(3) B19: Flip 1 to crit, this is where your bond flipping goes. Sometimes you deploy this if you can crit with her in very late stages of the game but she's spending most of her time in bonds.
-Deirdre 1 B06: You use this to catch any Larceis from retreat to cheat out more crits.
-Seliph 3(2) B15: Really, really, and I mean, REALLY! good bridge. It lets you unflip Larcei, which if you read Deirdre, is a thing this deck wants to do.
-Shannan 1: The premier swordboi of them all, absolutely do not leave deckbuilding if you don't have 4 of this fucker.
-Arvis 1: Very cheap pull, and you kind of need those in a deck entirely focused on sometimes speedrunning your opponent with big cost 1s and 2s.'''

        'promo': 'Sigrun, Empire-Guarding Holy Wings',
        'author': 'Aku',
        'explanation':'''It's a midrange deck, meaning you aim to take control of the game or in some cases, finish it by turn 5. There's not really much of a secret to playing this deck's first few turns, you just play your curve aggressively to set yourself up to win by turn 5 or turn 6 by utilizing Ike and/or Caeda. Sigrun rewards playing your curve as it naturally fills the condition for her summoning skill as your opponent clears your low cost units, so there's really no reason to keep holding on to them. After you promote, your priority should be getting the floodgate fairies onto the field as they are very good tap fodder for Sigrun's skill, providing value even though they can't hit. You should be using Sigrun's tap for +20 most of the time, because this deck normally runs 12 to 16 Sigruns, so get ready for unpleasant Sigrun selfs. Once the fairies have hit the field, you can think about the matchup you're playing, if Plumeria can significantly hinder your opponent's deploys (such as against big purple), you can opt to playing a slower game by stablishing more field presence before just going for game with Ike and Caeda 5. If they aren't as limited by Plumeria or if they are a base 70 MC, you can just go face and force your opponent to find an out to your strong fields every turn.''',
        'staples':'''-Maria 4(3): The flier deck staple, this card is broken and you are a dum dum if you don't put this in your deck;
-Caeda 5(4) Colorless: This is your finisher, this is usually what you'll be relying on to close out games;
-Haar 1: This card does just about everything Sigrun could want it to, it's good tap fodder, it provides movement on support and on field, and you can crit with it.
-Plumeria 2: This card hard presses top heavy decks to continuously remove her just so they can play the game, she also happens to be a 1-2 range, so she has additional utility by being able to crit from the backline when needed.
-Ike 4(3) B22: Your alternative to Caeda to end games. A bit harder to set up than Caeda, but he doubles as a removal tool. Being a 70 base in a flier deck is also an advantage.
-Caeda 4(3) B13: Draws on non MC hit, provides extra tempo midturn and happens to be Caeda 5(4) evades, she's just extremely solid.
-Mirabilis: Extremely useful in matchups where Zephiel exists, still good when he doesn't. Being a 0 cost colorless card is just a very nice tool for Sigrun to have, and while some may argue she's not a must have, there's very few cases where she hurts your deck for being there. '''
